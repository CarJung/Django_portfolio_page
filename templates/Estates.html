The goal of this project was to analyze the Warsaw housing market. I used data from the website otodom.pl. The data was scraped using Python and BeautifulSoup. The data was then cleaned and analyzed. The analysis was done using Python and Pandas. The results were visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The project was done in Jupyter Notebook. I have also hosted simple report using streamlit app. Besides that I used python Mlops framework pycaret to create a model to predictign the price of the flat.
